This repo contains books, videos, online classes and other resources which helped me.

Many of the books and videos I read/watched I can't remember exact their names so I didn't put it here.

## Books

### Management books

[Principles](https://www.principles.com/)

by Ray Dalio. This is a book that is recommended by lots of people. The [Chinese translation](https://www.amazon.cn/dp/B078FFX8B6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1524072013) is good enough to capture the idea if you don't want to go through English version. Other good resources about this book: [bridgewater principles](https://trello.com/b/TOgl8gtB/ray-dalio-bridgewater-principles), [principles summary](https://inside.bwater.com/publications/principles_excerpt).

[The Management Myth](https://www.amazon.com/Management-Myth-Experts-Getting-Wrong/dp/0393065537)

This is the best management book I've ever read about management. Management is not a science, and should not be guided by MBAs from consulting firms like BCG or McKinsey. By giving a brief history of scientific management and many insightful ideas, the author made a conclusion that be a good manager is simply a good educated and trusted person with ethics.

[Puritan Gift](https://www.amazon.com/Puritan-Gift-Reclaiming-American-Financial/dp/184511986X)

insightful book about business management and leadership. In the end the author summarized 25 rules for management.

### Chinese books

[道德经 - Tao Te Ching](https://www.scribd.com/document/206278860/Lao-Tse-Tao-Te-Ching)

信言不美，美言不信；善者不辩，辩者不善；知者不博，博者不知。

不自见，故明；不自是，故彰；不自伐，故有功；不自矜；故长；夫唯不争，故天下莫能与之争。

...

[论语 - Confucian Analects](https://www.scribd.com/document/215323973/%E8%AE%BA%E8%AF%AD-%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E7%89%88)

不患人之不已知，患不知人也。

知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧。

益者三友，损者三友：友直，友谅，友多闻，益矣；友便辟，友善柔，友便佞，损矣。

...

[庄子 - Chuang Tzu](https://www.scribd.com/book/358285430/Chuang-Tzu)

人生天地之间，若白驹过隙，忽然而已。

相呴以湿，相濡以沫，不如相忘于江湖。

井蛙不可以语于海者，拘于虚也；夏虫不可以语于冰者，笃于时也；曲士不可以语于道者，束于教也。

...

[史记 - Records of the Grand Historian](https://www.scribd.com/book/338677271/Records-of-the-Grand-Historian)

顺，不妄喜；逆，不遑馁；安，不奢逸；危，不惊惧；胸有惊雷而如平湖者，可拜上将军也。

反听之谓聪，内视之谓明，自胜之谓强。

居，视其所亲；富，视其所与；达，视其所举；穷，视其所不为；贫，视其所不取。五者足以定之矣。

...

[长短经](https://book.douban.com/subject/2076962/)

知人者，王道也；知事者，臣道也；无形者，物之君也；无端者，事之本也。

政教文质，所以匡救也。当时则有之，过则舍之。

[毛泽东选集](https://book.douban.com/subject/1139360/)

To make it easy - Mao could be treated as the most successful product manager. Lots of people has prejudice on him. But if you read his articles, you would know why he and his company defeated the giant 100 times bigger - Jiang's government. He clearly drew the persona of classes in China, and pointed out who's the users, what's the vision to gain these users and markets. His philosophy and methodology is pretty practical. e.g. he got out of the build and chat with different users, his famous quote - "he who makes no investigation and study has no right to speak".

鸡蛋因适当的温度而变化为鸡，但温度不能使石头变为鸡。

冲动是艺术家的品质，沉着是政治家的品质，果断是军事家的品质，历史上杰出的领袖人物往往能集三者于一身。

一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。

除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显着特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。

### Management and Leadership

[How to build a company where the best ideas win | Ray Dalio](https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_dalio_how_to_build_a_company_where_the_best_ideas_win)

worth to watch twice. See how Ray uses radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making to create an idea meritocracy where people can speak up and say what they really think.

[How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

golden circle and the question "Why?". Example about Apple is great.


[Really achieving your childhood dreams - Randy Pausch](https://www.ted.com/talks/randy_pausch_really_achieving_your_childhood_dreams)

Last lesson from Prof. Randy Pausch. The best inspiring video I ever had. Many many life lessons for leadership. Some quotes:

> Have something to bring to the table, because that will make you more welcome.

> Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. You've got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn't going to work.

> The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.

> Never lose the childlike wonder. It's what drives us.

> Apologize when you screw up and focus on other people, not on yourself.

> Be prepared. Luck is truly where preparation meets opportunity.

[Spotify culture - 1](https://vimeo.com/85490944) [Spotify culture - 2](https://vimeo.com/94950270)

very inspiring engineering culture. Must watch.

[Lead like the great conductors](https://www.ted.com/talks/itay_talgam_lead_like_the_great_conductors)

The conductor spread happiness. Make people your partners. Doing without doing.

> the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that. And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. So control is no longer a zero-sum game. You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together, in partnership, brings about the best music. So Kleiber is about process. Kleiber is about conditions in the world.

[As work gets more complex, 6 rules to simplify](https://www.ted.com/talks/yves_morieux_as_work_gets_more_complex_6_rules_to_simplify)

Yves from BCG gives a set of great rules to help with the engagement of teams, which, are pretty close to what the book Principles suggested. Highly recommend to watch (focus on the content, not his accent please).

The rules are:

* understand what your people do? what is your real work? we need to go beyond their jd, the surface of the container
* reinforce integrators. Removing the layers, proxies of reality. removing rules, give powers
* increase total quantity of power. To let people to use their own judgment, their intelligence. Give people enough cards for them to play, to take risks, to move out of insulation.
* Extend the shadow of the future: create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions.
* Increase reciprocity: by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient. Remove 2nd TV, they waste resources, don't add value and just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.
* reward those who cooperate.

[The puzzle of motivation](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation)

Traditional rewards aren't always as effective as we think.

### Psychology

[positive psychology 1504 by Tal Ben-Shahar](http://open.163.com/special/positivepsychology/)

This is the best online class I've ever had. It gives me lots of inspiring ideas. I shared many of concepts, stories, arguments to my teams. e.g. tunnel vision, downward spiral, belief is self-fulfilling prophecy, pay it forward, be the change you want to see in the world, don't think about the pink elephant (people follow what you do, not what you see), etc. Highly recommended to spend 40 - 80 hours with it.

Unfortunately, I can only find the full course in NetEase Open Course for now (don't worry about Chinese characters, just click the 1st video link. The subtitles are in Chinese but the content is still in English). I can't find a full list of the classes in youtube or Harvard U.

### Computer science

[Inventing on Principle - Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366)

This is the video I showed to the Tubi team during lunch time.

Bret talks about having a principle to follow when inventing new things. A principle that guides you in your decisions instead of concentrating on the product you want to build - "creators need an immediate connection to what they create"

[The future of programming - Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/71278954)

Again, Bret's inspiring talk. Worth watching.

* coding -> direct manipulation of data
* procedures -> goals and constraints
* text dump -> spatial representations
* sequential -> concurrent

[The value of Values - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM)

Changing the ways I think about values. A programmer shall watch all Rich's talks even if he or she's not fan of clojure.

[The language of the system - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROor6_NGIWU)

Very good talk about what is a language and a system.

[Spec-ulation - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk)

Talks about dependencies, versioning and how's software (interface) evolved

[Hammock Driven Development - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

How to do better design - solve the problem!

[Transducers - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII)

A new pattern that introduced in clojure and ported to many other places. Very deep thought. You may also want to watch his talk: [Inside transducers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KqUvG8HPYo) as well.

[Are we there yet? - Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey)

The reexamination of basic principles like state, identity, value, time, types, genericity, complexity, as they are used by OOP today, to be able to create the new constructs and languages to deal with the massive parallelism and concurrency of the future.

[Simplicity Matters - Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)

Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability. You may also want to check [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

[The mess we're in - Joe Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4)

Lots of insightful ideas by Joe. And one should never miss Joe's talk.

[The Forgotten Ideas in Computer Science - Joe Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I_jE0l7sYQ)

what problems to solve, what books to read, and rules to follow.

[The Most Important Design Guideline - Scott Meyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tg1ONG18H8)

Most important design guideline for high-quality software is: interface design. And this is also why when I talked about code review, I asked the team to focus on the interface, and not too worry about implementation details. Bad interface with good code results in disaster, while good interface with bad code is fixable.

[Boundaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOYal8elnZk)

An exploration of the boundaries between pieces of code, including: isolated testing, behavior vs. data, mutation vs. immutability, how data shape affords parallelism, transforming interface dependencies into data dependencies, etc.

[Syntaxation - Douglas Crockford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlqv6NtBXcA)

Lots of thoughts on syntax. Very interesting.

[Forget Velocity, Let's Talk Acceleration - Jessica Kerr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbcyyu8XB_Y)

Amazing presentation - even if you don't buy in her idea you shall check how she presents. Jessica inspired me to buy an iPencil and Paper app. I tried this style of presentation when I talked about scheduler in a BBL in Tubi, then I found notability is a better tool fits me, so I did [my talk on code beam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwHtlmyxE6c) using it.

### Call for actions

[Try  something new for 30 days](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days)

If you really want something badly, you can do it in 30 days. small changes = sustainable.

[What I learned from 100 days of rejection](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection)

What impressed me most is that he ask for a olympic donut, and the staff in the store made that for him.

Sometimes, just by simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends. So don't be shy and ask for help bravely.
